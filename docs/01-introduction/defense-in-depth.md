# Defense in Depth

## Overview
A cybersecurity strategy employing multiple layers of security controls throughout an IT system.

## The Layers

### 1. Physical Security
- Security guards
- Biometric access
- Surveillance cameras
- Secure facility design

### 2. Network Security
- Firewalls
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Network segmentation
- VPNs

### 3. Host Security
- Antivirus software
- Host-based firewalls
- Patch management
- System hardening

### 4. Application Security
- Secure coding practices
- Input validation
- Regular security testing
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

### 5. Data Security
- Encryption
- Data loss prevention (DLP)
- Backup strategies
- Data classification

## Implementation Strategy

### Perimeter Defense
- External firewalls
- DMZ configuration
- Border routers
- External threat intelligence

### Internal Defense
- Network segmentation
- Internal firewalls
- VLANs
- Zero Trust Architecture

### Endpoint Defense
- Endpoint protection platforms
- Device encryption
- Mobile device management
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)

## Benefits
- Multiple barriers to attackers
- Redundancy if one layer fails
- Time delay for attacks
- Increased detection capabilities

## Challenges
- Increased complexity
- Higher maintenance costs
- Potential performance impact
- Management overhead

## Real-World Examples
- Military installations
- Financial institutions
- Healthcare organizations
- Government agencies
