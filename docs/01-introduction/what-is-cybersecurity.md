# What is Cybersecurity?

## Overview
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. It encompasses technologies, processes, and controls designed to safeguard digital assets and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

## The CIA Triad - Core Principles

### Confidentiality
Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals, systems, or processes. This is achieved through:
- **Encryption**: Transforming data into unreadable formats
- **Access controls**: Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Data classification**: Categorizing data based on sensitivity

### Integrity
Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle. This involves:
- **Hash functions**: Verifying data hasn't been altered
- **Digital signatures**: Ensuring authenticity of digital messages
- **Version control**: Tracking changes to data and systems

### Availability
Ensuring information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users. This includes:
- **Redundancy**: Backup systems and failover mechanisms
- **Disaster recovery**: Plans and procedures for system restoration
- **DDoS protection**: Mitigating denial-of-service attacks

## Types of Cybersecurity Threats

### Malware
Malicious software designed to harm or exploit systems:
- **Viruses**: Self-replicating programs that infect files
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts data and demands payment
- **Spyware**: Secretly monitors user activity
- **Trojans**: Disguised as legitimate software

### Social Engineering
Manipulating people into revealing sensitive information:
- **Phishing**: Deceptive emails or messages
- **Pretexting**: Creating fake scenarios to obtain information
- **Baiting**: Offering something enticing to lure victims

### Network Attacks
Targeting network infrastructure and communications:
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Intercepting communications
- **SQL Injection**: Exploiting database vulnerabilities
- **Zero-day exploits**: Attacks on unknown vulnerabilities
