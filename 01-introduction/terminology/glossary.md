**APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)** - A prolonged and targeted cyberattack in which an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period.

**Authentication** - The process of verifying the identity of a person or device.

**Authorization** - The function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources.

## B
**Backdoor** - A method of bypassing normal authentication in a system.

**Botnet** - A network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge.

**Brute Force Attack** - A trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number.

## C
**CIA Triad** - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability - the three core principles of information security.

**Ciphertext** - Encrypted text that is unreadable until decrypted.

**CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** - A list of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

**Cyber Kill Chain** - A model for understanding the stages of a cyberattack.

## D
**DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** - An attack where multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system.

**DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** - A physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services.

**DNS (Domain Name System)** - The phonebook of the Internet that translates domain names to IP addresses.

## E
**Encryption** - The process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access.

**Exploit** - A piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability.

## F
**Firewall** - A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.

**Fuzzing** - An automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs.

## H
**Hashing** - The process of converting an input of any length into a fixed-size string of text.

**Honeypot** - A security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems.

## I
**IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention System)** - Devices or software applications that monitor network or system activities for malicious activities.

**IOC (Indicator of Compromise)** - Pieces of forensic data that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network.

**IoT (Internet of Things)** - The network of physical devices embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity.

## M
**Malware** - Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.

**MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)** - An attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties.

## P
**Phishing** - The fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.

**Penetration Testing** - An authorized simulated attack on a computer system to evaluate its security.

**PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)** - A set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates.

## R
**Ransomware** - Malware that threatens to publish the victim's data or block access to it unless a ransom is paid.

**Rootkit** - A collection of software tools that enable unauthorized access to a computer or area of its software.

## S
**Sandbox** - A security mechanism for separating running programs, usually to mitigate system failures or software vulnerabilities.

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** - Software products and services combining security information management and security event management.

**Social Engineering** - Psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.

## T
**Threat Actor** - An individual or group that performs an attack or is responsible for a security incident.

**Threat Vector** - The method a threat actor uses to gain access to a system.

**Trojan Horse** - Any malicious computer program that misleads users of its true intent.

## V
**VPN (Virtual Private Network)** - Extends a private network across a public network, enabling users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to the private network.

**Vulnerability** - A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat actor.

## W
**WAF (Web Application Firewall)** - A specific form of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web application.

**Whitelisting** - A security practice where only pre-approved programs, IP addresses, or email addresses are allowed access.

## Z
**Zero-day** - A vulnerability in software that is unknown to the vendor and for which no patch is available.

**Zero Trust** - A security model that requires all users, even those inside the organization's network, to be authenticated and authorized.
