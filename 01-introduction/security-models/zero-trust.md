# Zero Trust Architecture

## Overview
A security model that assumes no trust by default, requiring verification for every access request.

## Core Principles

### 1. Never Trust, Always Verify
- Verify explicitly
- Use least privilege access
- Assume breach mentality

### 2. Microsegmentation
- Divide networks into small zones
- Separate access for each zone
- Individual zone protection

### 3. Least Privilege Access
- Grant minimum necessary access
- Just-in-time access
- Regular access reviews

## Key Components

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Identity federation
- Privileged access management

### Network Security
- Software-defined perimeters
- Microsegmentation
- Encrypted connections
- Continuous monitoring

### Device Security
- Device health verification
- Compliance checking
- Mobile device management
- Endpoint protection

### Data Security
- Data classification
- Encryption everywhere
- Data loss prevention
- Rights management

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Identify Sensitive Data
- Data discovery
- Classification
- Flow mapping

### 2. Map Transaction Flows
- Understand data movement
- Identify access patterns
- Document dependencies

### 3. Architect Zero Trust Network
- Define micro-perimeters
- Implement controls
- Establish policies

### 4. Create Policies
- Access policies
- Device policies
- Data policies
- Threat protection policies

## Technologies Enabling Zero Trust

### Identity Providers
- Azure AD
- Okta
- Ping Identity
- Keycloak

### Network Security
- Software-defined WAN
- Next-generation firewalls
- Cloud access security brokers

### Security Analytics
- User and entity behavior analytics
- Security information and event management
- Extended detection and response

## Benefits
- Reduced attack surface
- Improved compliance
- Better visibility
- Enhanced data protection

## Challenges
- Cultural resistance
- Implementation complexity
- Legacy system integration
- Initial cost investment
