# The CIA Triad

## Overview
The CIA Triad is a foundational cybersecurity model representing three core principles of information security.

## Confidentiality
Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals.

### Key Techniques:
- Encryption (AES, RSA)
- Access controls (RBAC, ABAC)
- Data classification
- Authentication mechanisms

### Common Threats:
- Data breaches
- Eavesdropping
- Insider threats
- Social engineering

## Integrity
Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data.

### Key Techniques:
- Hash functions (SHA-256, MD5)
- Digital signatures
- Version control systems
- Checksums and parity bits

### Common Threats:
- Data tampering
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Malware infections
- Unauthorized modifications

## Availability
Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.

### Key Techniques:
- Redundancy
- Load balancing
- Disaster recovery
- DDoS mitigation

### Common Threats:
- Denial of Service attacks
- System failures
- Natural disasters
- Ransomware attacks

## Real-World Applications
- Financial institutions prioritize confidentiality
- Healthcare systems balance all three principles
- E-commerce platforms focus on availability
- Government agencies emphasize integrity

## Trade-offs
- Sometimes one principle must be balanced against others
- Example: Strong encryption (confidentiality) may impact performance (availability)
